      <b>Azurite is a community driven project</b>
      <br />
      <br />
      Unlike other websites, Azurite does not have ads. I believe that ads can
      be distracting and ruin the overall experience of the website.
      <br />
      <br />
      Instead, I put a lot of effort into making sure that Azurite is a great
      place for you to find and install mods. I also try to make sure that the
      website is fast and secure.
      <br />
      <br />
      If you would like to support Azurite, you can do so by donating or
      becoming a patron. Any amount helps, and it allows me to continue working
      on the website.
      <br />
      <br />
      Thanks for using Azurite, and I hope you enjoy it!
