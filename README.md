## Introduction

Azurite is a website where users can upload, share, and download mods for their favorite games. It provides a user-friendly interface for browsing mods, searching for specific ones, and managing your own uploads. I'm working on making it a mod manager too, but that's a ways off.

## Features

- **Exsists**: The site exsists! New stuff comming soon!
